room1
You wake up from your sleep with a sense of loneliness. You brush it off as simply a little bit of anxiety, but you feel different somehow. You turn on your tv, but nothing will show on the screen other than one instruction: “help”. You can’t help but feel like this word will do something...
You reach for the door handle, then you realise. Where is your hand? Where is your body? You’re entirely incorporeal. You’re just reading text on a black void. You’re viewing yourself entirely from the third person. You are in the backrooms, a concept you thought was an urban myth. How did you get here? Scratch that, it isn’t important. What’s important is how you get out.
room2
Upon entering the next room, despite not having any senses, you can feel that you are no longer alone. Something’s watching you. But from where?
An entity! It was hidden among the rest of the infinite nonsense. Now that you’ve noticed it you can’t unsee it, at least of this type. It seems like it wants to fight. Try typing “fight”.
The next door! At this rate, you’ll be out of here in no time. Only <UNDEFINED> more rooms to go. Wait, how many? Doesn’t that mean infinite? Looks like you’re gonna need to get a little creative to get out.
room3 
Goodness, these rooms are getting weirder and weirder. Where even am I? 
Nice! You made it up the ledge! Good j- w-w-w-w-w-we-we- We interrupt this train of thought to warn you that if you continue upon this path, you’ll feel more than just us watching you.
room4
What just happened? Was that an entity? Entities? How many? You can’t tell… Wait, what’s this? A box? Has every room had one of these? Looks like if you drop an item anywhere in this room it gets teleported to the box. It’s not very big though, it looks like it could only hold three items. 
Something feels intense. You definitely weren’t supposed to complete that test. What have you brought upon yourself now?
