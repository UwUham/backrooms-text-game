room1: You're in your bedroom. At least you think so. There's a blunt knife on the floor, but it still looks like it could do a little damage. The south door leads to the corridor, and for some reason you feel like you can go there just by saying "corridor". Your bed is in the corner of your room, as it always has been. There's not much you can do with it though.
room2: You're in the corridor. You can't see around the corner, but you don't feel alone anymore. That's scary. There's a key on the floor with two little wings on it. The corridor leads out to a lobby.
